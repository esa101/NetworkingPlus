# NetworkingPlus
Nano/Tetra networking module with more option for client AP creation. 

Just replace the files with those on the /pineapple/modules/Networking

Do a refresh of pineapple gui management console.
Enable -> Allow Associations

Client AP is also being use by PineAP. So this might disrupt how Pineapple Wifi Works.
